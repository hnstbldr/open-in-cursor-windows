# open-in-cursor-windows
This repository provides a small, safety-first PowerShell script that adds an "Open in Cursor" entry to the Windows context menu for folders, folder backgrounds, and files.  The script is user-scoped (HKCU only), requires no administrator privileges, creates backups before modifying the registry, and includes an uninstall path.
